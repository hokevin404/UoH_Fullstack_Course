# Introduction to React

We will now start getting familiar with probably the most important topic of this course, namely the React-library. Let's start off with making a simple React application as well as getting to know the core concepts of React.

The easiest way to get started by far is by using a tool called create-react-app. It is possible (but not necessary) to install create-react-app on your machine if the npm tool that was installed along with Node has a version number of at least 5.3.

Let's create an application called part1 and navigate to its directory.

```
npx create-react-app part1
cd part1
```
The application is run as follows:
```
npm start
```
By default, the application runs in localhost port 3000 with the address http://localhost:3000

Your default browser should launch automatically. Open the browser console immediately.
